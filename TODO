Inconsistencies
---------------
* fix map or story: cove with drain-lever is underground/water in sc16 (else just water)
* add water-drain 'sink hole' to southern scenarios 8,10 (similar to sc16) ?
* when storing units at the end of a scenario, leave a fake image in place.

Coding
------

* see TODO marks in the source */*

* unify [gold] MACROs: hidden|visible|chest || cave,land,both
* clean up .cfg coding style -> macros + style + ordering

# Note when modifying the main map:
  -> new villages in mountains -> landvillages  in utils/cave_*
