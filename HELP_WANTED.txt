Roboke Island is a huge project, if you like it, please consider contributing.
The first and foremost issue is play-testing: Find bugs, help balance
scenarios,..

Please also see the TODO file. If you want to get involved further,
there's a wish-list of items below.

As always, any feedback is welcome.

Screen Writing
==============

  - revise dialogs & story - it's currently rather verbose.
	- improve Inglisch
	- check for non-linearities & inconsistencies
	- new character-names for supporting actors
	  e.g. "Aloha" the merman, "Reddie" the red-mage, "Blackie" Amazon,
		"Ignisador/Oceb" Great/Evil mage, "Ka'la'lau" the dragon,...


Graphic Design
==============

The three main character could use some personality.

 * Admiral Roboke, Captain of a galleon, island explorer and protagonist
currently uses 'portraits/humans/transparent/duelist.png' which works well but
could use some individual characteristics. 

 * Monsieur Canoneér, the dwarvish canon expert
currently uses 'portraits/dwarves/transparent/thunderer.png' which kind of fits.
Somewhere along the story he 'invents' some amazing ship-mounted canon, but he's
not always on board and also uses his thunderstick regularly.
Monsieur Canoneér is from the royal special task force commando, although the
story leaves it up for interpretation if that's a ruse, he's a bit of an
entertainer, too.

 * Mistress Rosie, the first opponent turns into an ally in scenario 6
She's a somewhat sexy Amazon (matriarchy, dominant female), but the childish
playful type, always ready to quip and fool around. The unit is a Thief,
advancing to Assassin.

Oh and there's the [Amazon] Queen, she's a real dominant female. The current
image is somewhat sexist (but rightfully so). She not only seduces men (and
mermen) but also has them burned alive. A gorgeous ferocious vamp.

Pretty much all graphics could be improved, actually :)

The weakest images are IMHO 
  - images/story/roboke_dragon.png
	- images/story/old_book3.png
	- images/story/dwarven_map1.png


Unit Design
===========

 * Amazon Warriors. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons
They're currently Elvish Archers, Elvish Shamans and their advancements.
That works very well, except for the pointy ears :)
Some of the 'mistresses' are also thief/assassin units where it's appropriate:
skirmish, backstab, poison :)

The story originally intended them to be a mix between human and mermen:
  "It turned out that either combination will only produce a woman, elf-like,
but aging faster than normal humans, much like hatching from an egg directly
into puberty."

Yet, since merpeople probably lay eggs, and the inter-species mix became
irrelevant to the storyline, it's no big deal. In the story grown-up
amazon warriors are however only 2-4 years old. Hey, it's fantasy.

 * Dwarvish Galleon & Speed Boats
see units/boats.cfg
They could use some graphic-design, attack animation as well as clean-up.
Oh, and 'SpeedBoat' needs a better name.
