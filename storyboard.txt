# Roboke's mystic Island

Location
========
A remote island in the great ocean west of Wesnoth.

Huge Mountain/Volcano in the center (dragon)
East: wet, rainy full of rivers and cascades (farmland)
North: beautiful shores. 'Breeding ground' for Merpeople
West: predominantly dry - home of the amazon women
South: inaccessible cliffs, mountains - underwater caves

The whole mountain is an underground-cave and the
clue of this campaign is a two layer map.

The center can only be reached from the east-side - give or take a
few hidden cave entrances..

The natural formation of rivers on the east side of the island has been exploited
to construct an elaborate systems of dams and semi-artificial lakes in the hills.
Which allows to cut off parts of the island from others (incl caves).

The Heroes
==========

The Protagonist is "Captain" (actually Admiral) Roboke. Seafarer in the employ
of the City of Elensefar.  He is sent on a secret mission to follow smugglers.

On board with him is are First Mate "Skipper" - he's a better drinker and fighter
than a Navigator, but he knows all the captains and boats that passed though Elensefar
since he was 5 years old..

And an expert Canoneer - delegated by the city-council to join this secret mission
(yes, he's a dwarf).

In the first scenario, our team captures Miss Rosie - who will join the forces
(against her own kind) in chapter 6.

In the middle of the 2rd Part (chapter 13), the party frees a red-mage - currently
called 'Reddie'.

Many heroes come and go throughout this story. eg. Mdme. Mere, but the aforementioned
five need to make it to the end. Quite literally.

Part I: Stranded
================

Background story -- the tale of the mermen
------------------------------------------

(Player gets most of this info after the 1st part, when freeing mermen on the north short)

The mermen were on this spot for a long time.

There is underwater fire that warmed the water pleasantly but more importantly
the sea created stone out of the fire, it spew out arcs and columns which were then
crafted by mermen into a large temples and a surrounding underwater city.

It was the largest underwater village and a holy place to mer-kind.

But the flow of stone was relentless and only within a few generations..

...the fire was above ground without water to stop it.
And with the fire, there came the dragons.

The dragons continued our work and shaped the hills, collapsing some of the
larger underwater temples into lakes and laid the groundwork for tunnels.

It took only a few more years until thing settled down
and one day a great rumble and the middle of the island blew off in a great
fountain of fire.

The legend says that it was so hot that it could even burn dragons.
because after that many of them were gone and there was large crater in
the middle of the island where most of the drakes had been.

The changes to our society however were not as fast to adapt. It took
a generation - all those how had known the underground tunnels - until
merkind accepted the loss of the temples to the land and the dragons.
And various foolish events to retake the old sacred ground were abandoned.

The dragons prefer the hills and can avoid water in general.
and we mermen kept to the water.

There were still occasional conflicts - mostly on the green eastern-part of the
island where dragons occasional hunt and mermen cultivated fish and crabs or
sometimes hang out in the south-eastern marshlands;
but it was quiet and peaceful time in general.

Then men came. Maybe 50 of them.
They replenished supplies, fixed various parts of their ships and
on the day after they encountered the first dragon, some of us mermen
agreed to make contact as well.

It was maybe our advice to keep away from the hills or the recommendation to leave
that made them look further.. but shortly thereafter they found shiny gems of
breathtaking colours in the eastern hills. And half of the men
left in a hurry on the boat.

Over the following weeks, the men left behind grew bored and fancied
the company with the mer-kind, swimming, telling tales and some trading.

They also took a great liking to our women and were making them presents:
gems that they crafted from the shiny stones in the hills.
Ornating their beauty to the point of worshipping them as goddess.

And then the ship came back and it was not only one ship, but ten.
And they brought not only men but also very small men the size
of children but with long beards. There were also soldiers that surrounded
their body in metal and using long pikes.

It was a curious sight from afar.
The soldiers were able to drive the dragons away with the pikes
And the small men dived into the mountains, expanding the old
tunnels and mining even bigger jewels.

Women started cultivating the fields on the eastern shore
and men started building three castles close by.
One in the southern swamp which is hard for the dragons to access
and two in the north-eastern lagoon lakes.

The southern swamp is a place frequented by mermaid lovers the
southern caste was built as a temple to a beautiful mermaid named
"Lolita". Some of the men and even women came to see her and bring
her gifts and worship her.

(some of the men drew comfort and engergy from the audiences,
others only came to the city for playing and entertainment)

The place also attracted many other young mermaids who would like
to live some of Lolita's glory.

At that time mer-men started to compete with the men's presents and gifts.
Diving deep, searching unique shiny pearls in the waters and silver algae
strands. Many even adopted the worshiping and female leadership.

It was around that time that the humans killed the first dragon and bolstered
by the victory started building more castles to fortify the position in the eastern
hills.


Seeing the fortifications in the hills, Lolita asked the men to take
back the old holy ground - the lake north of the crater - from the dragons,
and build a second temple for her there.

Lolita ordered some mermen to assist the humans.

It was the mermen and dwarfs that eventually made the difference:
Together they build a large system of water-gates: both underground and over-ground.

...Collapsed parts of mountains. At first they closed off the eastern part of the island.
There were only two passes in and out of the mountains.

Many of the men moved to the west which was then inaccessible by the dragons, while
the dwarfs expanded the tunnels in the east, connecting them with the dragon
caves and flooded large parts of them with water from two sides, locking the dragons in.


With other ships there came small ugly creatures, small like the dwarves but they were not
proud miners but the aggressive dirty kind. The men whipped them, tied them up in chains and
made them work in the mines and offering them up as dragon fodder if necessary.


Construction of Lolita's temple went all but smooth.

The remaining dragons were still strong and fortified their position in the center
and not only held the ground around the crater-lake but also attacked the endeavour
to build the temple north of it, killing many of the dwarves both who were along
with some mermen, the main workforce on tunnels and castles in the mountains.

It was also the dwarves that noticed the value of the pearls and jewels that mermen
bragged about to have brought back from the deep water.

Lolitas' temples was never completed. In the heat of the battles and reorganization
many of the mine-shafts were strategically collapsed and fewer jewels came out of the
mountain.

At first it was Lolita who sent mermen to search for underwater jewels to spur on
the dwarves, and compensate them for the collapsed mines.
Soon it became a sport to become a merman diver, then an obligation,
and not long after slavery.

Men started to enclose the north-shore area where most of the pearls were found
and built camps for mer-men divers shipping off many of the harvested the pearls.

The whips and shackles that were in regular use for the goblin miners were soon
commonly used to convince and coerce mer-men as well.

But the dwarves were greedy, it turned out that they built their own set of tunnels
and did not flood all of them permanently but constructed a complex system of levers
and traps..

We don't know if it was a mistake or intention by the dwarves but they left an open cave
to the east. One day a hoard of dragons emerged and destroyed much of the eastern shore,
killing Lolita on their way and freeing some of the goblins on the way who turned against
the humans.

While many though this would bring an end to the matriarchy amongst mer-kind it turned
out to be the opposite. Mermaids fighting for dominance, enslaving their own kind sometimes
with the assistance of humans, building cages and nets.

With the next boat there arrived two very strange creatures a robed human that was worshipped
and a pointy eared woman that emitted a slight glow and seemed to never touch the ground
but always slightly float above it.

Soon after their arrival, the dwarves vanished and after some ferocious battles that took
many men's lives, the dragon attacks suddenly stopped.

The tale is that they used some magic to tame the dragons, but after a moon's time it turned out
that the spell comes at a cost. Sacrifices will have to be made.

Some Mermen were ordered to assist building a temple in the heart of the crater in the dragon's lair.
but few who have seen it ever returned.

Meanwhile most of the remaining mer-men were imprisoned in the northern enclave,
not allowed to leave and guarded by vicious mermaids when diving for pearls.

(With the dwarves and most of the fighters gone), a similar changed happened to the human society.
Rich traders who lived on the western shore soon succumbed to both women and mermaids.
